Have you ever heard of group called [_PRE-ENGINEERS_](https://github.com/AGH-Narzedzia-Informatyczne-2022-2023/PRE-ENGINEERS/wiki)?

If not, no worries, because you certainly will soon!

I am currently working with five amazing people on new app called StydUnity. The main objective of our project is to create an inimitable and user-friendly community that will support students all across the country. We desire to create a safe space where our beloved peers could exchange notes or knowledge of various kind to help each other survive those sometimes extremely difficult years.
